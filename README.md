You'll have to install "Vim-plug" in order to make the .vimrc work. To do this, run the following command in your terminal: curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

Move the .vimrc file to your home directory or update your current one with the file on this repo.
After this, open a new Vim window and type :PlugInstall on command mode. After completing the installation, restart Vim.
